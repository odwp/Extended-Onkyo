# Extended-Onkyo

If you have found this through a search for Hubitat drivers for Onkyo receivers, this is based off of Steve Vibert's (SteveV) driver.  IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THIS, BEWARE, THIS IS AN **ALPHA** VERSION. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I have been working with Steve to extend his driver's functionality to include button functionality to change inputs.  This makes presenting the functionality easier to present on a dashboard.

I have also added auto discovery of ONE receiver, the first one to respond, and its assocciated zones.  Managing the auto discovery of more than one receiver would require creating a Hubitat app.  That is not in either of our plans at this time.  I expect the auto discovery of multiple receivers is an edge case only applicable to a very few installations.
